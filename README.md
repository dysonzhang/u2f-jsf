U2F with JavaServer Faces
=========================

This is very basic web application which demonstrates U2F in a JavaServer Faces
stack. You can just throw the WAR file in Apache Tomcat and see for yourself.

Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) is proposed open standard for an easy to use, secure 
and anonymous two-factor authentication (2FA). Universal means you can use your
2FA token on many different services. Itâ€™s already supported in Chrome and
Firefox (with an add-on).
